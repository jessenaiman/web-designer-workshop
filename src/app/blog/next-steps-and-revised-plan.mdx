With the foundational structure of the WebCraft Studio now in place, we are moving into a phase focused on bringing our components to life with interactivity and powerful AI capabilities. This revised plan outlines the next steps to realize the full vision of the project.

## Revised Project Plan

Our work is now broken down into three focused phases:

### Phase 1: Activating the Design Library

The immediate priority is to make the Design Library fully interactive and intelligent.

<div className="grid gap-4 my-6">
    <Card>
        <CardHeader>
            <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
                <Milestone /> Phase 1: Activating the Design Library
            </CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    **Component-Specific Logic:** We will implement the state management and event handlers for each component in the library. This will transform them from static previews into fully interactive examples that users can manipulate directly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **AI-Powered Customization:** The "Component Customizer" will be brought online. This involves building out the Genkit flow that takes a user's prompt (e.g., "make this button pulse red") and dynamically generates the corresponding React component code. The frontend will be updated to render this AI-generated code in the preview.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </CardContent>
    </Card>
</div>

### Phase 2: Expanding AI Capabilities

Once the core library is interactive, we will expand our AI-driven features.

<div className="grid gap-4 my-6">
    <Card>
        <CardHeader>
            <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
                <Milestone /> Phase 2: Expanding AI Capabilities
            </CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    **AI Chat Enhancement:** The AI Chat Assistant will be upgraded from providing mock data to offering genuine design and development advice, helping users make informed decisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Generative Asset Integration:** The AI Image and Video Creator tools will be fully integrated. Users will be able to generate assets and see them applied directly to components within the workshop, streamlining the content creation process.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </CardContent>
    </Card>
</div>


### Phase 3: Collaboration and Sharing

The final phase will focus on building out the features that make this a truly collaborative tool.

<div className="grid gap-4 my-6">
    <Card>
        <CardHeader>
            <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
                <Milestone /> Phase 3: Collaboration & Sharing
            </CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    **User Accounts & Saving:** We will implement user authentication to allow individuals to save their customized components and personalized style guides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Team Workspaces:** The ultimate goal is to enable teams to create shared libraries, ensuring design consistency and a single source of truth for all members.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </CardContent>
    </Card>
</div>

This revised plan sets a clear path forward, building upon our solid foundation to create a truly innovative tool for design and development teams.
