# Enhanced Web Design Workshop Project Plan

## Project Vision and Goal

### Core Purpose
This project is a communication and collaboration tool designed to reduce friction between managers, designers, and developers. The website acts like a physical workshop, providing interactive previews, customizations, and tools for web design techniques.

### Key Success Criteria
- Users can quickly review, customize, and share design techniques.
- One representative page per category (e.g., Animations, Text, Backgrounds, Buttons) using the preview-tile + dialog-editor pattern.
- Scalable structure for adding more content without disrupting core functionality.
- No authentication, persistence, backends, CMS, or exhaustive libraries in v1.

### Collaboration Feature
To support collaboration:
- Generate a unique, shareable URL for any customized component.
- Encode the component's state (e.g., settings, text) into URL query parameters.
- When opened, the link loads the component with exact customizations applied.
- Implementation: Use URLSearchParams for encoding/decoding state. Integrate into the dialog editor's "Share" button (add this button alongside save, view code, copy, reset, close).

## Development Approach

### Overall Process
Build incrementally using a multi-stage, sequential approach. Decompose tasks into small, verifiable sub-tasks. Implement one at a time, verify alignment, and seek confirmation before proceeding. This ensures the scaffold (structure, layout, functionality) is complete before adding content.

At each major stage start, restate connection to the vision: "This stage connects to the project vision by [brief explanation], reducing friction in [specific workflow aspect]."

### Task Decomposition Guidelines
- Break goals into sub-tasks with clear objectives, dependencies, and verification criteria.
- Adhere to conventions: Absolute imports (`@/components/...`), "use client" for interactive components, Tailwind for styling, shadcn for themes, shared contexts for state.
- Use clean App Router structure under `src/app/...` with nested layouts.
- Client-side only; no server actions in v1.
- After each sub-task: Summarize implementation, provide code snippets, state fulfillment, and ask: "Does this meet requirements? Verify before proceeding."

### Phase 1: MVP Goals and Decomposition
Focus on scaffolding the general structure, layout, and core functionality. Include every detail for sequential steps. Only add representative content after scaffold review.

#### Goal 1: Core Layout Setup
Connects to vision by establishing a consistent navigation and workspace, enabling quick access for all team roles to reduce misalignment.

Sub-tasks:
1.1: Implement Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
   - Include HTML/body with lang="en".
   - Add ThemeProvider for dark/light mode (use next-themes).
   - Set global metadata: title="Web Design Workshop", description="Collaborative design tool", favicon.
   - Styling: Base font (Inter), background/text colors via Tailwind.
   - Verification: Page loads with theme toggle functional, no errors.

1.2: Implement Main Application Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
   - Compose Sidebar, Header, and flexible Main Content Area.
   - Accessibility: ARIA roles (nav for sidebar, header, main).
   - Responsive: Sidebar expanded on lg+, collapsed on md, mobile menu on sm-.
   - Verification: Layout renders correctly across breakpoints; skip links work.

1.3: Implement Sidebar (`src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`).
   - States: Expanded (text+icons), Collapsed (icons), Mobile (hidden).
   - Features: Toggle button, logo top, nav links (Dashboard, Design, Style Guides, Templates, Settings), active indication, footer.
   - Navigation: Dashboard (/), Design (/design), Style Guides (/styleguides), Templates (/templates), Settings (/settings).
   - Accessibility: Keyboard nav, ARIA.
   - Use icons from lucide-react.
   - Verification: Toggle works, links navigate, accessible via keyboard.

1.4: Implement Mobile Menu (`src/components/layout/mobile-menu.tsx`).
   - Trigger: Hamburger in header.
   - Behavior: Drawer from left, touch-optimized.
   - Content: Mirror sidebar nav.
   - Accessibility: Focus trap, ARIA.
   - Verification: Opens/closes on mobile, nav works.

1.5: Implement Header (`src/components/layout/header.tsx`).
   - Features: Mobile menu button, page title/breadcrumbs, user menu (placeholder: profile, settings, logout), theme toggle.
   - Styling: Fixed height, border-bottom.
   - Verification: Controls functional, responsive.

After completing Goal 1 sub-tasks sequentially, review full layout before proceeding.

#### Goal 2: Design Section Scaffold
Connects to vision by creating a workbench for interactive design review, allowing teams to experiment and share without code handoffs.

Sub-tasks:
2.1: Set up Design Layout (`src/app/design/layout.tsx`).
   - Mount DesignControlsContext Provider.
   - Include floating DesignControlsBar.
   - Wrap children in grid container for previews.
   - Verification: Layout renders with bar, context available.

2.2: Implement DesignControlsBar (`src/components/design/design-controls-bar.tsx`).
   - Floating bottom bar.
   - Controls: Play, Stop, Reset (global), Text input (applies to all previews).
   - Use DesignControlsContext for state.
   - Verification: Controls update global state.

2.3: Implement DesignControlsContext (`src/components/design/design-controls-context.tsx`).
   - Provider with global state: { playing: boolean, text: string, ... }.
   - Hooks: useDesignControls() for read/update.
   - Verification: State persists across components.

2.4: Implement ComponentControlsContext (`src/components/design/component-controls-context.tsx`).
   - Per-component overrides: Similar to global but instance-specific.
   - Effective settings: Merge global + overrides.
   - Hooks: useComponentControls().
   - Verification: Merging logic works in tests.

2.5: Implement PreviewTile (`src/components/design/preview-tile.tsx`).
   - Minimal card: Preview area, title, open editor button.
   - On click: Open dialog with editor.
   - Use effective settings from contexts.
   - Verification: Renders preview, opens dialog.

2.6: Implement Dialog Editor Pattern (using `src/components/design/design-controls-customizable-card.tsx`).
   - Dialog: Radix Dialog, lazy mount.
   - Body: Large preview + controls panel.
   - Buttons: Save (local state), View Code (modal with code), Copy (clipboard), Reset (clear overrides), Close, Share (generate URL with params).
   - Share: Encode state to ?settings=base64(json).
   - Decode on load via useEffect.
   - Verification: Dialog opens, controls update preview, share URL loads state.

2.7: Set up Category Layouts (e.g., `src/app/design/buttons/layout.tsx`).
   - Tab header for sub-pages (e.g., Overview, Animate CSS, Tailwind, MagicUI).
   - Mount in nested routes.
   - Verification: Tabs navigate between sub-pages.

After Goal 2, add placeholder pages for categories (Buttons, Text, Effects, Backgrounds, Page Transitions, Content Layout) with empty grids. Review scaffold before adding representative content.

#### Goal 3: AI Integration Scaffold
Connects to vision by providing AI-assisted customization and answers, streamlining ideation and reducing back-and-forth.

Sub-tasks:
3.1: Set up AI Layout (`src/app/ai/layout.tsx`).
   - Simple layout with nav to sub-sections.
   - Verification: Renders children.

3.2: Implement Component Customizer (`src/app/ai/component-customizer/page.tsx`).
   - Input: Text prompt.
   - Features: Refine prompt button, preview, save/view code/copy.
   - Placeholder: Mock AI response generating a PreviewTile.
   - Verification: UI functional, mock flow works.

3.3: Implement Chat (`src/app/ai/chat/page.tsx`).
   - Simple chat interface.
   - Placeholder: Mock responses based on workshop content.
   - Verification: Messages send/receive.

3.4: Implement Image Creator (`src/app/ai/image-creator/page.tsx`).
   - Prompt input, refine, aspect ratios, generate button.
   - Placeholder: Mock image output.
   - Verification: UI options update preview.

Review AI scaffold; integrate real APIs later.

#### Goal 4: Additional Sections Scaffold
Connects to vision by providing references and templates for consistent development.

Sub-tasks:
4.1: Blog (`src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`).
   - Dynamic route, placeholder content.
   - Verification: Renders slug-based page.

4.2: Styleguides (`src/app/styleguides/nextjs/page.tsx`, etc.).
   - Pages for Next.js, Radix UI, Tailwind with docs links and examples.
   - Verification: Pages load.

#### Goal 5: Final Polish and Review
- Add representative content: One page per category with 1-2 PreviewTiles.
- Test shareable URLs end-to-end.
- Ensure no new features; focus on scaffold completion.
- Full review: "First pass complete. Review work before adding content." 

## Components Directory
